default parameters builds the following {partner-product-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.footnote:note[The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips this component and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.]
* In the public subnets:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.footnote:note[]
** An Amazon EC2 instance running {partner-company-name}.
* In the private subnets:
** An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) MySQL database used by {partner-company-name} to store metadata.
** An Amazon EMR cluster used by {partner-company-name} to run extractions and transformations.
* An Amazon S3 bucket used by {partner-company-name} to store extracted and transformed data.
* One AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key used to encrypt secrets within {partner-company-name}.
* Four AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:
** One attached to the {partner-company-name} Amazon EC2 instance.
** One attached to the Amazon EMR cluster nodes.
** One used by Amazon EMR for provisioning and service-level actions (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-iam-role.html[EMR Role^]).
** One used by Amazon EMR for auto scaling (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-iam-role-automatic-scaling.html[Auto Scaling Role^]).

If the "Availability" parameter is set to "High Availability", the following {partner-product-name} architecture is deployed.
